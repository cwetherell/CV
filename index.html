    <p>My extensive experience in customer service required a focused attitude towards the needs of others
        which helped me to accomplish excellent people skills and interpersonal skills. My passion for knowledge
        in web design and my previous role in administration has helped me achieve great computer skills in
        all that would be required in an office based position. My Adaptable mind set enables me to adopt new
        roles when needed. I would also relish the opportunity to train in a more senior capacity and develop
        existing skills.
